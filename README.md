# hibernate-lazyinitializationexception

This repository is set up with the intention of providing concrete examples to go with the technical article that I have written at https://jonasbockstal.dev/post/dissecting-the-hibernate-lazyinitializationexception-cause-and-solutions/

It includes a main branch that is in a faulty state, meaning that it is in a state that throws a LazyInitializationException when the only controller method is invoked. Every other branch contains one of the solutions that is discussed in the article.
